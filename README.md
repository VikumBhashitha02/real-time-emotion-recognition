# 🎥 Real-Time Multi-Face Emotion, Gender & Age Detector

This project uses **OpenCV** and **DeepFace** to capture live webcam video and perform real-time analysis of **multiple faces** simultaneously.
For each detected face, it estimates:

* 😀 **Dominant Emotion** (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.)
* 👩‍🦱 **Gender** (male / female)
* 🎂 **Approximate Age** (in years)

A green rectangle is drawn around every face with the predictions displayed above it.

## 🚀 Features

* Detects **multiple faces** in a single frame.
* Real-time predictions of **emotion**, **gender**, and **age**.
* Simple to run on any machine with a webcam.
* Press **`q`** to exit the application.
